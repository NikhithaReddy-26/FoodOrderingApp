# Food Ordering Application

A sophisticated platform designed for the seamless ordering of food, equipped with a robust backend powered by Spring Boot and fortified with secure authentication mechanisms. The application is built using a modern tech stack that includes Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, JWT, OAuth 2.0 Spring Security, microservice architecture, Service Registry, and API Gateway.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Backend:** Utilizes the power of Spring Boot for a high-performance backend infrastructure.
  
- **Secure Authentication:** Implements secure authentication mechanisms, including JWT and OAuth 2.0 Spring Security.

- **Microservice Architecture:** Follows a microservices-based architecture for scalability and maintainability.

- **Service Registry:** Incorporates a Service Registry for effective management and discovery of microservices.

- **API Gateway:** Utilizes an API Gateway for streamlined communication and management of APIs.

   git clone https://github.com/NikhithaReddy-26/FoodOrderingApp.git
   cd FoodOrderingApp
2. **Open in IntelliJ IDEA:**
       - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
       - Select "Open" and choose the root directory of the cloned project.

3. **Run Microservices:**
       - Open each microservice in IntelliJ IDEA and run them individually.
4. **Run API Gateway:**
       - Open the API Gateway module in IntelliJ IDEA.
       - Run the application.

5.  **Run Discovery Server:**
       - Open the Discovery Server module in IntelliJ IDEA.
       - Run the application.

6. **Check Connections using Postman:**
       - Open Postman.
       - Test the different endpoints of the microservices through the API Gateway.
       - Ensure that the services are registered with the Discovery Server.
